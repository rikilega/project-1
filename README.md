## What Is This?:

In my journey to becoming a legitimate coder/develope, this is the first graded project for the coding bootcamp I am attending.  In this challenge we were given some working starter code and I completed the following: 

* **HTML elements**: Made changes to HTML to ensure that when the source code is viewed that all semantic HTML elements can be identified and they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

* **Icon and Image elements**: Added accessible alt attributes to icon and image elements.

* **Heading attributes**: Ordered heading attributes in sequential order.

* **Title**: Added a concise descriptive title

## Purpose of This Work:

Accessibility is improved by the changes made to the html and css files. By completing this challenge I was able improve my understanding of html and css syntax, implement learnings from the past week and hone my resource finding skills.
